# Inventory App

### Pretend you have a warehouse filled with items attached to locations (hangers) put-away on racks. Many of these items are in their correct resting place (on the racks). Others, however, are incorrectly on the racks. The goal of this challenge is to build an app that allows you to scan a full rack of items and will give feedback on the items on that rack.
